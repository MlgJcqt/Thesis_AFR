# Compute_SLR

> Both scripts have to be checked and modified (paths, method etc) before running


[1] exe_R_LR.py

--> python script calling fit_distr_LR_py.R to compute SLR in batches


[2] fit_distr_LR_py.R

--> score-based likelihood ratios computation with Weibull/Normal/GEV/KDE distributions (to choose within the script)
